# Multiple-Importance-Sampling-and-Indirect-Lighting
Implementing a technique called multiple importance sampling that can greatly increase the
reliability and efficiency of Monte Carlo integration. It is based on the idea of using more
than one sampling technique to evaluate a given integral, and combining the sample values
in a provably good way.
